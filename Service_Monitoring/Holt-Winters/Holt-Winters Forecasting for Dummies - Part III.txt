Holt-Winters Forecasting for Dummies - Part III

In Part I we’ve learned how to forceast one point, in Part II we’ve learned how to forecast two points. In this part we’ll learn how to forecast many points.

More Terminology
Season

If a series appears to be repetitive at regular intervals, such an interval is referred to as a season, and the series is said to be seasonal. Seasonality is required for the Holt-Winters method to work, non-seasonal series (e.g. stock prices) cannot be forecasted using this method (would be nice though if they could be).

Season Length

Season length is the number of data points after which a new season begins. We will use L
to denote season length.

Seasonal Component

The seasonal component is an additional deviation from level + trend that repeats itself at the same offset into the season. There is a seasonal component for every point in a season, i.e. if your season length is 12, there are 12 seasonal components. We will use s to denote the seasonal component.
